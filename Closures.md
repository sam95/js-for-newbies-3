## Closures 
What are closures? Why are they required in the first place? 

Let's look at an example to learn their importance. We have seen how every function can access a global variable. Let us take a very simple example to count the number of times a function is called.
```javascript
var counter = 0;

function add() {
    counter += 1;
}
add();
add();
add();

// value of the counter is 3.
```
Everything in the above code is nice and good ðŸ˜‡. But there are a lot of restrictions for this to work. 

1. `counter` should be accessible and changed only by `add()` method.
2.  No other program should alter the variable `counter`.

It is highly unlikely to work if we have restrictions like the above. Let's try this in another way.
```javascript
function add() {
    var counter = 0;
    counter += 1;
}
add();
add();
add();
```
If we declare the variable `counter` inside the function, where are we going to store the incremented value every time? This approach does not work as well.

What if we have a nested function? Good idea, seems to work. Let's try it out.
```javascript
function add() {
    var counter = 0;
    function plus() {counter += 1;}
    plus();    
    return counter; 
}
```
Oops, there are a lot of problems with the above code too, `plus()` is visible only to the `add()` function. How are we gonna call it from outside?

Also, we need to find a way to execute the below line only once. That is a big problem too.
```javascript
var counter = 0;
```

So how do we approach this? **`closures`** to the rescue.
```javascript
var add = function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {
      return counter += 1;
    }
}();
add();
add();
add();
```
Woohoo! We have solved the problem. But the above code looks very very odd. Let's try to break it down bit by bit.

The below line is executed only once. Confused? Wait for me till I go through the whole flow!
 ```javascript
 var counter = 0;
 ```
 The best part is that, `counter` can still be accessed even after parent function has been closed! That's the beauty of **`closures`**.
 
By this, we have made `counter` private. The `counter` is protected by the scope of an anonymous function, can be changed by `add()` only.
